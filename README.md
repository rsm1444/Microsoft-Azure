# Microsoft-Azure
Microsoft Azure and Scalability  Created a web service that allows a user to login,   and upload either: a textual note or a single   picture (these may be a grocery list, a reminder, a   todo list, a picture of a bag of rice, or similar – a   quick note or picture).  Each note or picture have a one-word subject   (such as “todo” or “groceries”), these subject   words do not need to be unique (there may be   several grocery lists), and each note or picture   have a priority (10 is very important, 0 is not   important). Each picture or note have an upload   time associated with it.  A user will be able to upload a note or picture, set   the subject, and priority; or, see notes and   pictures (for that user), sorted by time and date   (youngest or oldest first), or priority, or subject.   Users will be able to delete a note or picture.  Multiple users may use your service   simultaneously.   Scaling a web service: web service automatically scale to support more,   simultaneous, use.  Multiple users will be able to post and inspect   pictures and notes concurrently, and the system   will not slow down, your goal should be 1   second (2 second maximum) response.
